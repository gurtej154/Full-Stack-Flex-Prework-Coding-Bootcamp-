    <br>
    
    <br><p3 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"> Meduza had a massive hit with their 2019 single "Piece of Your Heart." Combining smooth vocals hooks with a melodic house backbone,<br> the trio's signature song was streamed hundreds of millions of times as they became more recognized on the EDM festival circuit.</p3>
    
    <br>
    </br>
    
    <p5 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meduza a production team of three friends and colleagues formed in Italy in 2014 with the vision of producing music for Rnb and hip-pop base.</p5>
    <p6 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">However, during the process, they were not having any considerable amount of success, so they switched their music category to house-influenced sound and commenced their production of songs as officially the Meduza in 2018.</p6>
    <p7 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Meduza was still struggling to hit the big stage with their content and style of music, so they collaborated with a production team from the United Kingdom known as the Goodboys.</p7>
    <p8 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Their first official song “Piece of Your Heart in collaboration with Goodboys was released in the beginning of February 2019, becoming an overnight success story, and bringing Meduza onto the big stage.</p8>
    <p9 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After their first song, the trio produced a second song called “Lose Control”, again collaborated with Goodboys.</p9>
    <p10 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The second song was also a hit and was streamed in the multitude of the millions, making Meduza become a club-hold name.</p10>
    <p11 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">After the success of both tracks, the team maintained the momentum and released another song called “Paradise” featuring Dermot Kennedy, however this time without the collaboration of Goodboys.</p11>
    <br> </br> 
    <P12 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Music is becoming revolutionary throughout the decades, as we saw bands mix vocals and musical instruments together to create something unique that brought masses of crowds together.<br> Now we are witnessing the rise of digital music through production teams, such as Meduza who are shaping modern music into an exquisite sound.</P12><br>
